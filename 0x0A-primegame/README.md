0x0A. Prime Game

For this project, you will need to leverage your understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario. The challenge involves determining the winner of a game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

Concepts Needed:

1. Prime Numbers:
a. Understanding what prime numbers are.
b. Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.

2. Sieve of Eratosthenes:
a. An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for this task.

3. Game Theory:
a. Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
b. Understanding win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.

4. Dynamic Programming/Memoization:
a. Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.

5. Python Programming:
a. Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
b. Arrays and lists for storing the integers and tracking removed numbers.
